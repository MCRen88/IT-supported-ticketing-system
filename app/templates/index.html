      <h2>The Inspiration:</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the rise of usage of virtual systems, support ticket systems
        have come into prominence. Addressing the issue tickets to appropriate
        person or unit in the support team has critical importance in order
        to provide improved end user satisfaction while ensuring better
        allotment of support recourses. The assignment of help ticket to
        appropriate group is still manually performed. Especially at large
        organizations, the manual assignment is not applicable sufficiently.
        It is time consuming and requires human efforts. There may be
        mistakes due to human errors. Also resource consumption is carried
        out ineffectively because of the misaddressing. On the other hand,
        manual assignment increases the response time which result in end
        user satisfaction deterioration. In this study, an extension to ITS
        for auto-addressing the issue ticket to the relevant person or unit
        in support team is proposed.
      </p>
      <h2> What it does?</h2>
      <p>
        A ticketing system streamlines, centralizes and manages all your IT
        tickets. Take email requests and transform them into service tickets
        automatically. From the initial ticket request and creation to
        resolution and closure ticketing system software helps you through
        every stage. In the support process, incoming new tickets are
        analyzed and assessed by organization's support teams in order to
        fulfill the ticket request. In a large organization, better allocation
        and effective usage of the valuable support resources is directly
        results in substantial cost cuts.
      </p>
      <h2>How we built it?</h2>
      <p>
          In this system, machine learning techniques and other algorithms which
          proven performance in text processing are used. Machine learning
          algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SGD classifier,
          Multinomial NB, Decision trees and Random Forest algorithm. NLP is used
          in preprocessing the data.
