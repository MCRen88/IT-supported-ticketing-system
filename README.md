# IT Automated Ticketing System

Due to the rise of usage of virtual systems, support ticket systems have come into prominence.
Addressing the issue tickets to appropriate person or unit in the support team has critical
importance in order to provide improved end user satisfaction while ensuring better allotment
of support recourses. The assignment of help ticket to appropriate group is still manually
performed. Especially at large organizations, the manual assignment is not applicable
sufficiently. It is time consuming and requires human efforts. There may be mistakes due to
human errors. Also resource consumption is carried out ineffectively because of the
misaddressing. On the other hand, manual assignment increases the response time which result
in end user satisfaction deterioration. Multiple-choice systems which provide the user to choose
the related categories or unit within defined categories may seem like better, but the systems
are not useful because of those users, especially new users which have never used the system
before, usually have no idea about the related category or department. Also users do not want
to fill long ticket forms which are needed to identify the issue. In this study, an extension to
ITS for auto-addressing the issue ticket to the relevant person or unit in support team is
proposed.

In this system, machine learning techniques and other algorithms which proven performance
in text processing are used. The recommended method provides high quality user support and
boosts end-user satisfaction. It reduces manual efforts and human errors while ensuring high
service levels and improved end-user satisfaction.
